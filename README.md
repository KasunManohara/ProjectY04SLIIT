üòü The Problem

Mushroom cultivation is a vital agricultural practice, but it faces significant hurdles that impact yield and profitability:

    Contamination: The growth process is highly susceptible to contamination from bacteria and rival fungi (e.g., Trichoderma, Penicillium), leading to substantial crop losses. Current detection methods often rely on subjective, error-prone manual inspection.

    Suboptimal Yields: Optimizing environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and light for maximum fruit body yield is a complex task that requires constant monitoring and analysis.

    Lack of Data-Driven Decisions: Growers generate vast amounts of data but often lack the tools to visualize and interpret it effectively, making it difficult to identify trends, predict outcomes, and plan cultivation strategies.

‚ú® Our Solution

MushroomMatrix is an integrated platform that provides a suite of tools to tackle these challenges head-on. The application assists cultivators at every stage, from monitoring contamination to predicting yields and market demand.
üöÄ Key Features
1. AI-Powered Contamination Detection

    Sub-Objective: Develop an image processing model to automatically identify contaminated mushroom pots.

    How it Works: The system utilizes computer vision to analyze images of mushroom pots, detecting and classifying various types of contaminants.

2. Machine Learning-Based Yield Prediction

    Sub-Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict fruit body yield.

    How it Works: The model analyzes a combination of environmental factors to forecast the optimal conditions for maximizing yield.

3. Advanced Data Visualization & Forecasting

    Sub-Objective: Create a data visualization tool for demand and supply prediction.

    How it Works: A user-friendly dashboard visualizes real-time cultivation data, yield predictions, and forecasted market demand and supply for various mushroom varieties (e.g., American oyster, Milky white, Shiitake).

üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The system is designed with a modular architecture:

    Data Ingestion:

        Sensors: IoT devices in the grow shed collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels.

        Training Data: Historical datasets on consumer demand and mushroom supply are used to train prediction models.

    Backend Processing:

        Image Processing Model: Analyzes images to detect contamination.

        Yield Prediction Algorithm: Processes manually entered growshed data to predict fruit body yield.

        Demand & Supply Prediction Model: Analyzes market data to forecast trends.

    Frontend (Web Application):

        Dashboard: Presents all information through an intuitive web interface.

        Data Visualization Tools: Displays charts, graphs, of all collected and predicted data.
